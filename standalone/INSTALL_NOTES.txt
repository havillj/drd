Installation Notes for DRD (Denison Riboswitch Detector):

	1. Install mfold (http://mfold.rna.albany.edu/?q=mfold/download-mfold).
	   (May require additional packages, including gfortran.)

	2. Add the location of the mfold executable to your PATH variable in
	  .bashrc.

	3. Change into the drd directory and execute the
	
	      $ make
	      
	   command.  This will create the drd executable in the drd directory.

	OPTIONAL:

	4. In Makefile, change the drd installation directory (the value of 
	   INSTALLDIR) as desired.  (The default is /usr/local/bin.)

	5. Execute the 
	
	      $ sudo make install 
	      
	   command while in the drd directory.  This will copy the drd 
	   executable, the defFiles directory, and Ct2b.pl to the installation 
	   directory.  (sudo is not necessary if you are installing to a
	   directory that you own.)

DRD Execution (as displayed when executing drd --help):

	Usage: drd [--orfs orf_len] --ouput output_directory --ribo ribo_type1 [ribo_type2 ... ribo_typen] sequence_filename

	Command line options:
	--orfs orf_len
	    indicates that only riboswitches that are not within an open reading
	    frame with minimum length orf_len (measured in codons) should be
	    returned. 

	--output output_directory
	    indicates that output_directory is the directory to which results
	    will be written.  If the directory does not already exist, it will 
	    be created.

	--ribo ribo_type1 [ribo_type2 ... ribo_typen]
	    indicates the riboswitch types to search for.  The types are 
	    specified by the names of riboswitch definition files that 
	    are located in the defFiles folder.  (Do not include the .def 
	    extension.)
	    
	    For instructions on how to create your own riboswitch definition 
	    file, go to drd.denison.edu and hit the Help button.

	sequence_filename
	    the name of the FASTA file containing the input sequence(s). 
	    The sequence file may contain multiple sequences.
	    
	Example: drd --orfs 120 --output DRD_RESULTS --ribo TPP SAM-I seq_file.fasta

Output:

	DRD will create a subdirectory of the given "output_directory", named after
	the sequence file (omitting the suffix).  In this directory, you will
	find an HTML file named index.html that contains links to all of the
	results.  For example, for the example invocation above, the web page will
	be created at DRD_RESULTS/seq_file/index.html.  You can then open this HTML
	file with any convenient web browser.

Additional Notes:

	If you execute the DRD with the same sequence file in the same output
	directory twice, you will be prompted whether to overwrite the existing 
	results.

	Upon execution of the DRD, the output similar to the following may
	be displayed:

		1, 
		10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90, 
		End of Fill

	This is the result of the execution of mfold by the DRD, and may
	be ignored.

	The Ct2b.pl program, which is used by DRD, was created by M. Zuker 
	and can be found at
	http://mfold.rna.albany.edu/download/Utils/Ct2B.pl
